# About me

 * I trained in civil engineering before being adopted into geography.
 * My areas of interest include spatial analysis, spatial statistics, transportation, travel behavior, cities.
 * Also, too, mathematics, computer languages, science fiction, poetry, and memes.
 * I have been known to look professorial on occasion.
 * At this rate my only hope of being recognized is as the most promising oldest researcher in my discipline.
