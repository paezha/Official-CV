# About me

 * I trained in civil engineering before being adopted into geography.
 * My areas of interest include spatial analysis, spatial statistics, transportation, travel behavior, cities.
 * Also, too, mathematics, computer languages, science fiction, poetry, and memes.
 * I have been known to look professorial on occasion.
 * In 2010 a research team I led was recognized with the **Meredith F. Burrill  Award** of the Association of American Geographers for exceptional work at the intersection basic research in geography and policy.
 * In 2024 I was recognized with the **Edward L. Ullman Award** of the Association of American Geographers for lifelong commitment and contributions to the field of transportation geography.
