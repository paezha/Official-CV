   abstract = {Accessibility planning is a crucial alternative to mobility planning for reaching sustainable outcomes. Although there is a vast literature on accessibility, less attention is paid to accessibility as a relative concept, i.e., its relationship with the socio-economic characteristic of the population. While accessibility is known to vary by location, it also changes as a consequence of differences in individual willingness to reach destinations by certain transport modes. Using the city of Zaragoza, Spain as a case study, this paper evaluates relative non-motorized accessibility (walking and cycling) to three types of retail activities: daily, weekly, and incidental. First, a clustering process is used to identify four population groups according to their socio-economic characteristics (the young employed; the young unemployed; seniors and adults). Second, distance-decay functions based on time-willingness to reach retail destinations by non-motorized modes are compared between the four clusters of population. Third, relative accessibility maps based on gravity-based models are elaborated, highlighting places that exhibit statistical differences between the population clusters. The results indicate that willingness to reach retail stores on foot by seniors (>65 years old) was significantly different from the rest of groups analyzed, providing additional insights on how relative accessibility measurements can anticipate potential social exclusion risks.},

   abstract = {Background: Infant mortality is an important measure of human development, related to the level of welfare of a society. In order to inform public policy, various studies have tried to identify the factors that influence, at an aggregated level, infant mortality. The objective of this paper is to analyze the regional pattern of infant mortality in Brazil, evaluating the effect of infrastructure, socio-economic, and demographic variables to understand its distribution across the country. Methods: Regressions including socio-economic and living conditions variables are conducted in a structure of panel data. More specifically, a spatial panel data model with fixed effects and a spatial error autocorrelation structure is used to help to solve spatial dependence problems. The use of a spatial modeling approach takes into account the potential presence of spillovers between neighboring spatial units. The spatial units considered are Minimum Comparable Areas, defined to provide a consistent definition across Census years. Data are drawn from the 1980, 1991 and 2000 Census of Brazil, and from data collected by the Ministry of Health (DATASUS). In order to identify the influence of health care infrastructure, variables related to the number of public and private hospitals are included. Results: The results indicate that the panel model with spatial effects provides the best fit to the data. The analysis confirms that the provision of health care infrastructure and social policy measures (e. g. improving education attainment) are linked to reduced rates of infant mortality. An original finding concerns the role of spatial effects in the analysis of IMR. Spillover effects associated with health infrastructure and water and sanitation facilities imply that there are regional benefits beyond the unit of analysis. Conclusions: A spatial modeling approach is important to produce reliable estimates in the analysis of panel IMR data. Substantively, this paper contributes to our understanding of the physical and social factors that influence IMR in the case of a developing country.},

In Australia, despite the Commonwealth Government Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) Transport Working Group making over 40 recommendation,, for more sustainable urban transportation a decade ago, a recent Institution of Engineers Australia, Transport Panel found little progress with transportation indicators of sustainability and appropriate analytical techniques. A review of the international literature is made to determine definitions of a sustainable urban transportation and land use system, and objectives that would form the basis for determining suitable indicators of performance. Drawing on hierarchical diagrams from decision theory, we show the link between higher-level policy objectives for sustainability and lower-order actions, measurable attributes, and performance indicators. The analytical framework for sustainable urban transportation analysis includes descriptive statistics-exploratory and graphical methods, spatial mapping, spatial statistics (to identify geographical patterns and to identify outliers in the data), regression analysis, travel preference functions based on Stoufler's intervening opportunity model, and linear programming. These analytical techniques are illustrated with examples of travel and urban form in Sydney using data from the Census of Population and Housing, 1961-1996. The need for geographically based indicators and transportation and land use policies is emphasized.},

Trends that affect this balance include an aging population and increasingly large immigrant communities with lower donation rates. Blood agencies must implement several strategies to ensure a sustained supply of blood products. A better understanding of the determinants of donation frequency is essential to develop strategies that encourage new and existing donors to donate more frequently. In this study, we investigate the individual and contextual determinants of the decision to donate multiple times, with a particular focus on accessibility to clinics. The case study is the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area. Analysis is based on discrete choice models estimated using the attributes of the geocoded donors and clinics, and Census data for contextual variables. The results indicate that higher levels of accessibility increase the probability of donor return and more frequent donations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this work, spatial filtering is introduced in the context of modelling mortality for the first time in actuarial literature. Specifically, the objective of this research is to identify patterns in the spatial distribution of mortality rates for the sixty-five and older age group at the county level for the contiguous United States. The analysis carried out pertains to the spatial autocorrelation of these rates over time. The spatial filtering methodology is applied to uncover latent spatial patterns. Furthermore, the analysis reveals the extent to which these spatial patterns remained consistent across the years in the study. Results show the existence of spatial dependencies leading to an accompanying spatial filter. Thus, incorporating spatial filters as an exploratory tool in spatial analysis proves of considerable use when it comes to enriching traditional mortality models. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Concern over the high rate of contagion of COVID-19 has prompted world authorities to use the strategy of isolation and social confinement as the main non-pharmacological weapon against the disease that has rapidly killed millions of people worldwide. However, there is evidence that the denialist rhetoric of the Brazilian President has negatively influenced people's behavior in relation to obedience to confinement and social isolation measures. The aim of this study is to analyze the correlation between the Brazilian Presidentâs denialist rhetoric and the low adherence to social distancing measures and the subsequent increase of new coronavirus cases and deaths. Daily data on the level of contamination by COVID-19, social distancing and information from Brazilian states between the months of February and May 2020 were used. Taking into consideration the differences between the federal government of Brazil and state governors about the severity of the pandemic and the importance of social distancing, the article uses the Instrumented Difference-in-Differences approach, suggested by Duflo (2001), to obtain the causal impact of reduced social distancing, resulting from Presidential denialist rhetoric, in mitigating COVID-19 cases and deaths, taking into account the relationship between the president of the republic and the states as an instrument. The results suggest that the Brazilian average Social Isolation Index increased from 39.77% to 51% between February 1st and May 18th, 2020, the country would have had approximately 318,850.03 fewer cases of COVID-19, and more than 10.000 lives would have been saved.},

However, FCA methods do not fully consider aspects of travel and choicemaking behaviour as the only behavioural component is the impedance function. FCA approaches also tend to assign population demand to clinics and levels-of-service to population zones in an overlapping manner that has been shown to inflate/deflate supply and demand. While the adjustments proposed in the recent âBalanced FCAâ method can rectify this, it apportions population and levels of service in a fractional manner. In response, this research proposes a utility-based measure of healthcare accessibility based on a multinomial logit (MNL) destination choice model that avoids the multiple-counting issue in FCA methods. It also considers additional behavioural aspects that define the appeal of clinics in addition to the travel time required to reach them, including their capacity and level of crowding. Comparisons of the MNL approach with the original and balanced FCA models using data for the City of Hamilton, Canada, suggest that while the accessibility patterns produced by each method are broadly similar, some key differences exist in the calculated accessibilities and their spatial patterns. The MNL model in particular estimates higher accessibilities in suburban and rural areas. After considering their strengths and weaknesses, we argue that both the FCA and MNL approaches offer merit for planning and policy.}

   abstract = {Background: Children&rsquo;s access to non-school destinations is important for their well-being, but this has been overlooked in transport planning. Research on children&rsquo;s access to non-school destinations is growing, and there is a need for a comprehensive overview, examining both quantitative and qualitative studies, of the existing evidence on places that children access by active or independent travel. Objectives: Identify and summarize quantitative and qualitative research on the topic of active or independent travel to non-school destinations for elementary aged children (6 to 13 years old). Methods: Papers published in English between 1980 and July 2021 were sourced from: (i) Web of Science Core Collection; (ii) PubMed; and (iii) APA PsycInfo. Three relevant journals related to children and transport were hand searched: (i) Children&rsquo;s Geographies; (ii) Journal of Transport &amp; Health; and (iii) Journal of Transport Geography. The search was limited to peer-reviewed articles published in English between 1980 and July 2021. Covidence, an online software platform for systematic reviews, was used to organize articles during the title and abstract screening stage. PRISMA-Scr is applied for reporting. Results: 27 papers were retained from an initial 1293 identified peer-reviewed articles. The results reveal that children in different geographies travel unsupervised or by active modes to places that support different domains of their well-being such as a friend or relative&rsquo;s home, local parks or green spaces, recreational facilities, and different retail locations (e.g., restaurants). There is evidence that children&rsquo;s ability to reach certain places is constrained, likely due to safety concerns or environmental barriers. Conclusions: Research on children&rsquo;s diverse destinations is relatively limited as compared to trips to school. Various methodologies have been applied and can be combined to completement each other such as objective GPS tracking and subjective surveys on places children would go if they were available. Future research should clearly report and discuss the non-school destinations that children access to better inform transport planning and policy for all aspects of children&rsquo;s lives.},

Travel surveys can reveal the nature and distribution of bicycling trips, but perceptions and behaviours of bicyclists are better understood through qualitative methods. In particular, developing cycling cities are unique settings to examine how the built environment supports bicycling as changes are made to increase bicycling levels. Through semi-structured interviews, this research explores the case of Hamilton, Ontario and the factors that influence route choice from the perspective of regular bicyclists. Major themes were identified using thematic analysis: (i) exclusion from road space; (ii) infrastructure; and (iii) streetscape. Bicyclists highly value infrastructure and seek routes that minimize interactions with cars, while avoiding many arterial roads that prioritize motorists. Routes that appear to be more human-oriented or that have nature are also attractive. Many regular bicyclists report that current bicycle infrastructure does not meet their preferences. Despite building nearly half of the planned infrastructure network, our findings suggest the built environment is not perceived to be oriented to bicycling. This study provides policy and practice recommendations for developing cycling cities in North America as they transition towards established cycling cities.},

   abstract = {Background: Bicycling is known to have many health benefits. For this reason, transport planners and public health officials in Canada increasingly aim to encourage bicycling for transport. Onand off-street infrastructure is often implemented to facilitate bicycling and planners rely on a range of tools for informing the design of the network of facilities. This mixed methods study compares objectively measured attributes and bicyclists' perceptions of the built environment along inferred bicycle routes in Hamilton, Ontario. Methods: Environmental audits were conducted along six bicycle routes in Hamilton to document the attributes that might support or hinder bicycling. The routes were inferred based on the output of a model of bicycling flows. Bicyclists, 9 male and 5 female, then participated in semistructured interviews where a form of photo elicitation, which we call photo-journeys, was used to explore their perceptions and preferences of the routes. Interview data were analyzed using both inductive and deductive thematic analysis based on the categories of the audit instrument. Results: Bicyclists prefer routes that have dedicated bicycle infrastructure, or residential streets with low volumes of traffic even if they lack infrastructure. They dislike routes with busy arterial roads or that lack bicycle infrastructure. Their experiences and knowledge of bicycling in a city transitioning to be more bicycle-friendly revealed preferences that can help to improve existing infrastructure and bicycle routes, which may also help to reduce barriers for non-bicyclists. Conclusions: Photo-journeys are an innovative and practical approach to explore perceptions of regular bicyclists, which can be leveraged to inform policies and interventions to make bicycling routes and infrastructure safer and more attractive. Transport planners in developing cycling cities should pay attention to both the objective attributes of the built environment and how they are perceived by the public.},

In this case study, we investigate differentials in accessibility to stations using a balanced floating catchment area approach and compare accessibility with and without the equity stations. We analyze population interpolated to small cells to better reflect walking to a station and conduct a sensitivity analysis at several walking time thresholds. We then reaggregate the estimated accessibility by income groups for further analysis. Our findings indicate that equity stations increased accessibility for the serviced population at every threshold examined, but the increase was relatively modest especially for population in the bottom 20% of median total household income.}

As the number and proportion of older adults grows in many countries, and awareness of the benefits of active travel becomes increasingly evident, it behooves researchers to further investigate the safety of older pedestrians. This study contributes to the literature by examining the factors that influence older adults? susceptibility to pedestrian incidents (falls incidents and pedestrian-vehicle collisions). To this end, a sample of older adults living in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, South Ontario, Canada was surveyed. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), to identify several latent factors that are significantly associated with older adults? involvement in pedestrian incidents. The results revealed that the factors that affect older adults? susceptibility to pedestrian incidents are level of difficulty while walking, fear of falling, and crossing evaluation capability. In contrast, level of pedestrian confidence and level of risk-taking crossing behavior are not among the significant factors. It was also found that older pedestrians aged 65?75 years, males, and those who are still working had a greater probability to be involved in pedestrian incidents. These findings shed light on some key constraints of older pedestrians, and the extent to which each factor could improve their safety. This information, in turn, can be used by transportation authorities in prioritizing their plans, policies, and programs towards improving the safety and mobility of older pedestrians.},

  abstract = {Active school travel (AST) is promoted in many jurisdictions, including Ontario, Canada, where there is provincial support for school travel planning (STP) efforts. Two pillars of school travel plans in the province are education and encouragement. For these pillars to stand, relevant stakeholders must be cognizant of and understand the issues and stakes. For this reason, we deem it important to understand how AST is communicated. In this research we adopt framing analysis to investigate the ways in which various organizations communicate to the public around AST. A frame is a central organizing idea or story line that provides meaning to a particular phenomenon, and thus helps to set the parameters for conversations about policy. In the case of AST, framing can influence what policy alternatives are perceived as available by children, parents, and their wider communities. The research is supported by natural language processing techniques applied to publicly available documents from Ontario stakeholders involved in school travel planning. We then compare the findings from these documents to a selection of academic studies on AST. We conclude that framing of AST in Ontario is mostly empirical-scientific in style, and largely in agreement with academic research on AST. However, it is essentially conservative and does not challenge the status quo of motorized travel. Furthermore, the frames tend to download responsibility for change to households, which limits the scope of policy alternatives by keeping collective action out of the frame.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given an aging population that requires increased medical care, an increasing number of deferrals from the donor pool, and a growing immigrant population that typically has lower donation rates, the purpose of this article is to forecast Ontario's blood supply and demand. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We calculate ageand sex-specific donation and demand rates for blood supply based on 2008 data and project demand between 2008 and 2036 based on these rates and using population data from the Ontario Ministry of Finance. RESULTS: Results indicate that blood demand will outpace supply as early as 2012. For instance, while the total number of donations made by older cohorts is expected to increase in the coming years, the number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the 70+ age group is forecasted grow from approximately 53% of all RBC transfusions in 2008 (209,515) in 2008 to 68% (546,996) by 2036. A series of alternate scenarios, including projections based on a 2% increase in supply per year and increased use of apheresis technology, delays supply shortfalls, but does not eliminate them without active management and/ or multiple methods to increase supply and decrease demand. CONCLUSIONS: Predictions show that demand for blood products will outpace supply in the near future given current age-and sex-specific supply and demand rates. However, we note that the careful management of the blood supply by Canadian Blood Services, along with new medical techniques and the recruitment of new donors to the system, will remove future concerns.},

   abstract = {The study investigates the role of the built environment attributes and their contextual effects on travel behaviour. The study utilized a dataset of 4739 respondents elicited from an online survey distributed in Hamilton City, Canada. A Nested Logit (NL) model and a quadratic polynomial trend surface are employed to spatially investigate the determinants influencing mode choice behaviour. The study contributes to our understanding of how geography moderates the impact of built environment attributes on mode choice behaviour. Socioeconomic demographics are found to play a pivotal role in explaining Hamiltonians' mode choice behaviour. For built environment attributes, sidewalk density is positively associated with walking and public transit use. Moreover, bike lane density is positively associated with biking and negatively associated with public transit use. Regarding land-use entropy (mix), the results show that high land-use entropy is negatively associated with choosing the car as a passenger travel mode. From a contextual perspective, the results affirmed that the influence of built environment attributes is not equally efficacious across the city. Improving the built environment attributes across the city reveals a substantial increase in walking and biking while decreasing the probability of choosing other modes. However, it is noteworthy to mention that the influence of improving the built environment is not homogeneous over geography.},

   abstract = {The goal of this study is to develop and apply a new method for assessing social equity impacts of distance-based public transit fares. Shifting to a distance-based fare structure can disproportionately favor or penalize different subgroups of a population based on variations in settlement patterns, travel needs, and most importantly, transit use. According to federal law, such disparities must be evaluated by the transit agency, but the area-based techniques identified by the Federal Transit Authority for assessing discrimination fail to account for disparities in distances travelled by transit users. This means that transit agencies currently lack guidelines for assessing the social equity impacts of replacing flat fare with distance-based fare structures. Our solution is to incorporate a joint ordinal/continuous model of trip generation and distance travelled into a GIS Decision Support System. The system enables a transit planner to visualize and compare distance travelled and transit-cost maps for different population profiles and fare structures. We apply the method to a case study in the Wasatch Front, Utah, where the Utah Transit Authority is exploring a switch to a distance-based fare structure. The analysis reveals that overall distance-based fares benefit low-income, elderly, and non-white populations. However, the effect is geographically uneven, and may be negative for members of these groups living on the urban fringe. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Typically, a cross-validation procedure is used to determine a globally optimal window size. Preliminary investigations indicate that the global cross-validation score is heavily influenced by a small number of observations in the dataset. At present, the ramifications of this behaviour in cross-validation are unknown. The research reported here explores the extent to which individual and groups of observations impact optimal window size determination, and whether one can explain why some points are more influential than others. In addition, we strive to examine the impact neighbourhood specification has on model quality in terms of predictive capabilities and the ability of the method to retrieve spatially varying processes. The analysis is based on several datasets and using simulated data in order to compare and validate results. The results provide some practical guidelines for the use of cross-validation.},

   abstract = {The role of social contact as a motivator for mobility has gained interest in recent years with conceptual and empirical work that provides evidence of the importance of social context on travel behavior. On the other hand, the impact of different modes of transportation on the frequency and duration of contact has not been explored. Using the 1994 Portland Household Activity and Travel Behavior Survey, this paper investigates the potential relationship between automobility and the expected participation in and duration of a variety of in-home and out-of-home social activities. The analysis makes use of descriptive and inferential statistics to illustrate a broad variation in the effect of car use on duration of activity, both in terms of polarity and magnitude. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis reveals that reliance on the automobile acts by enabling longer durations in less mobile and more time-constrained segments of the population. Conversely it acts by decreasing durations in more mobile and less time-constrained subgroups. The paper ends by discussing directions for future research into the potential social implications of automobility. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Alleviating the disability challenges experienced by people with impairments is increasingly seen as an important step towards building more inclusive societies. The very definition of disability has evolved to shift the burden from people with impairments to perform at "normal" competency levels and towards a fuller recognition of the ways that society can either build or tear down barriers that hinder their full participation in society. The objective of this paper is to investigate the factors that act as facilitators or barriers to participation by people with impairments. Specifically, the study is conducted within the context of employment status and commute distance, two outcomes indicative of the ability of individuals with impairments to engage society. Analysis is based on Canada's 2006 Participation and Activity Limitation Survey, a post-censal survey that collects information on various aspects of disabilities for a representative sample of Canadian society. The results, based on a probit model for employment status and a regression model for commute distance, provide insights into the personal, economic, and living space factors that affect the probability of being employed and traveling longer distances.},

   abstract = {A fundamental role of an urban transportation system is to provide a means for individuals in society to access locations and participate in activities. This paper investigates how automobility, a system of land-use and mobility, imposes on the ability to participate in discretionary activities. A theoretical argument couched in time-geography is used to describe the mechanism through which activity dispersion and traffic congestion, both features of the current realization of automobility, hampers accessibility. The concept is illustrated with an analysis of synthetic space-time prisms constructed under a variety of travel speed and activity dispersion assumptions. Following this, a descriptive analysis of time-use data drawn from several cycles of the General Social Survey of Canada is used to empirically test the argument. The empirical investigation provides evidence of declining participation in a variety of discretionary, out-of-home activities, and an increase in the amount of travel required to reach activity destinations. The work trip in particular is shown to have increased significantly between 1992 and 2005 and activity profiles for drivers and non-drivers show that participation in discretionary activities is severely affected by the duration of the daily work commute. Participation however is more severely impacted by commute duration amongst non-drivers, indicating the relative benefit of being a non-driver in a compact urban form, versus potentially being excluded from participation as a non-driver in an urban spatial structure supportive of and constructed for the automobile.

To date, much of the empirical work on this topic is mainly spatial in nature despite recent developments that call for the inclusion of time use analyses in social exclusion research. In this paper we attempt to fill this gap by estimating activity and trip durations to determine whether poverty, old age, or being a single parent results in time use patterns indicative of exclusion. Given the importance of shopping and using services for social inclusion objectives, these activities are the focus of this investigation. In terms of methods, use of a multiple equation approach allows for the estimation of the daily duration of shopping activities and trips while simultaneously controlling for daily durations of four broad categories of activities as well as their associated travel times. The results indicate: that being a senior citizen increases travel durations while decreasing shopping activity durations; that coming from a low income household decreases shopping activity durations; and single-parent status does not impact shopping activity durations when holding income and other activity durations constant. These results highlight the feasibility and challenges of time-use and activity analysis in social exclusion research.},

In this paper we draw from recent advances in the spatial analysis literature to derive individualized measures of clustering and exposure. Recent research on accessibility has seen a shift from place-based measures to person-based ones. Similarly, the notion of residential clustering and exposure patterns, while typically related to the distribution of population in zonal systems, can be modified to account for heterogeneous experiences of urban space. In particular, at the individual level, the degree of clustering and exposure is related to personal mobility and the individual experience of space. In this paper we turn to the question of whether individuals belonging to different groups and living in different areas of a city observe differences in their clustering and exposure to population groups over space. The proposed procedure is applied empirically to the case of Montreal to explore how native English speakers of various levels of mobility experience exposure.},

An important item, which has not been investigated in this context, is the potential relationship between the topology properties of networks (or network descriptions of geographical systems) and the properties of spatial models and tests. The objective of this article is to investigate, within a simulation setting, the ability of spatial dependency tests to identify a spatial/network autoregressive model when two network topology measures, namely degree distribution and clustering, are controlled. Drawing on a large data set of synthetically controlled social networks, the impact of network topology on dependency tests is investigated under a hierarchy of topology factors, sample size, and autocorrelation strength. In addition, topology factors are related to known properties of empirical systems.},

An important aspect is that the tests are free of a priori assumptions about the functional form of dependence, making them especially suitable in situations where the dependence is nonlinear. We define the concept of a similarity relation, which is used to keep track of similarity between neighboring observations. This similarity count is used to construct new statistical tests based on both random permutation simulations and derived asymptotic distributions. We include a Monte Carlo study to better illustrate the properties and the behavior of the new tests under several synthetically generated processes. Apart from being competitive compared with other nonparametric and parametric tests, results underline the outstanding power of the new tests for nonlinear-dependent spatial processes.},

   abstract = {In the spatial analysis of crime, the residential population has been a conventional measure of the population at risk. Recent studies suggest that the ambient population is a useful alternative measure of the population at risk that can better capture the activity patterns of a population. However, current studies are limited by the availability of high precision demographic characteristics, such as social activities and the origins of residents. In this research, we use spatially referenced mobile phone data to measure the size and activity patterns of various types of ambient population, and further investigate the link between urban larceny-theft and population with multiple demographic and activity characteristics. A series of crime attractors, generators, and detractors are also considered in the analysis to account for the spatial variation of crime opportunities. The major findings based on a negative binomial model are three-fold. (1) The size of the non-local population and people's social regularity calculated from mobile phone big data significantly correlate with the spatial variation of larceny-theft. (2) Crime attractors, generators, and detractors, measured by five types of Points of Interest (POIs), significantly depict the criminality of places and impact opportunities for crime. (3) Higher levels of nighttime light are associated with increased levels of larceny-theft. The results have practical implications for linking the ambient population to crime, and the insights are informative for several theories of crime and crime prevention efforts.},

   abstract = {Recent studies empirically support the role of the built environment in inducing or hindering violent crime. Particularly, studies of the broken window theory have provided evidence that physical disorder is an environmental correlate of crime. This includes broken windows, vacant/abandoned housings, abandoned cars on street, graffiti, and decayed street lighting, among other things. Current studies are limited by the difficulty involved in collecting fine-scale quantitative environmental data. The conventional environmental audit approach, which aims to assess environmental features, is costly, time-consuming, and burdensome. In this study, we use Google Street View to study the relationship between violent crime and physical features of urban residential environment. More concretely, a Poisson regression model with spatial filtering is used to identify socio-economic correlates of violent crime. Parting from the hypothesis that omission of built environmental factors results in systematic residual pattern, we proceed to analyze the spatial filter to select sites for virtual environmental audits. A series of physical environmental factors are identified using contingency table analysis. The results provide both theoretical and practical implications for several theories of crime and crime prevention efforts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The temporal persistence of crime hot spots is recognized as a valuable indicator of consistent problem areas. The current literature has not adequately addressed the mechanisms that perpetuate or interrupt persistent crime hot spots. Investigating the persistence of violent crime hot spots in Columbus, Ohio, from 1994 to 2002, this study fills a gap in the literature by identifying neighborhood structural correlates that drive the persistence of hot spots. Specifically, this study identifies yearly crime hot spots, and estimates an ordered probit model to explore the neighborhood structural determinants. The results indicate that socio-economic factors, identified from a synthesis of social disorganization theory and routine activity theory, significantly correlate with persistent patterns of violent crime hot spots. This gives evidence that a combination of the two ruling spatial theories of crime provides an applicable framework for understanding the temporal dimension of violent crime hot spots. By identifying the factors that contribute to the persistence of hot spots of crime, insights gained from the results can help to inform focused crime prevention efforts.},

   abstract = {Two common practices in modeling of crime when crime data is available for multiple years are using single-year crime data corresponding to census data and taking the average of crime rate (or count) over multiple years. Current theoretical and empirical literature provides little, if any, rationale in support of either practice. Averaging multiple years is purported to reduce heterogeneity and minimize the measurement error in the year-to-year emergence of crime. However, it is unclear how useful the analysis of averaged and smoothed data is for revealing the relationship between crimes and sociodemographic and economic characteristics of every single year. In order to more clearly understand these two approaches, this paper applies a seemingly unrelated regression model to assess the temporal stability of model parameters. The model accounts for spatial autocorrelation among crime rates and social disorganization variables at the block group level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In this paper we analyze the changes in accessibility to emergency and community food services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the City of Hamilton, Ontario. Many of these food services are the last line of support for households facing food insecurity; as such, their relevance cannot be ignored in the midst of the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic. Our analysis is based on the application of balanced floating catchment areas and concentrates on households with lower incomes (<CAD40,000, approximately the Low Income Cutoff Value for a city of Hamilton's size). We find that accessibility was low to begin with in suburban and exurban parts of the city; furthermore, about 14% of locations originally available in Hamilton closed during the pandemic, further reducing accessibility. The impact of closures on the level of service of the remaining facilities, and on accessibility, was disproportionate, with system-wide losses exceeding 39%. Those losses were geographically and demographically uneven. While every part of the city faced a reduction in accessibility, inner suburbs fared worse in terms of loss of accessibility. As well, children (age <= 18) appear to have been impacted the most.},

abstract = {Although mode switching caused by COVID-19 is an important travel behavior question in the Global North, countries in the Global South, particularly South Asia, have yet to adequately identify how transportation systems and travel behavior have evolved due to the pandemic. To contribute to this question, this study explored changes in the use frequency of the most common non-active sustainable alternatives in Bangladesh, namely buses and rickshaws. By emphasizing attitudes and perceptions along with sociodemographic characteristics, this study contributed to the understanding of how different factors influence individualsâ shifts in the usage frequency of buses and rickshaws in Bangladesh. Our study suggested that in general, buses have lost more ridership than rickshaws. Findings from a multivariate ordinal model suggested that the middle-income group had reduced their bus use frequency, and the low-income group had increased their rickshaw use frequency during the first wave of the pandemic. Also, there could be a possible reduction in bus use in the post-lockdown and post-pandemic periods if the risk perception continues to remain in the public consciousness. Moreover, those who cared less about the social distancing measures and had confidence in their immune system had increased their bus use frequency during the pandemic. Compared to bus use frequency, there have been fewer changes in rickshaw use frequency during the pandemic, indicating that rickshaws had become a comparatively more viable mode during the pandemic. Based on the findings, the study discussed the policy implications of keeping buses and rickshaws as viable, sustainable transport modes in the post-pandemic period.}

Based on the available literature in the Global South, the paper aims to: (1) provide an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the personal daily travel of different socio-economic and demographic groups during COVID-19; (2) synthesise the literature to explore the needs of the different socio-economic and demographic groups; and (3) identify groups who received less attention in transportation research in the Global South so far. The paper reviewed 47 studies and found that while investigating personal travel during COVID-19, the most explored socio-economic and demographic attributes were sex, age, income, occupation and educational qualifications. Some regional differences were evident in terms of mode choice during COVID-19. Through the review, it is also noticeable that none of the studies explored LGBTQ+ communitiesâ and individuals with disabilitiesâ transportation needs and challenges and how COVID-19 has impacted their personal travel. Other overlooked socio-economic and demographic groups in the Global South whose personal travel during COVID-19 and the post-pandemic period needs investigation are migrant and seasonal workers, children and youths, ethnic minorities, racial minorities, religious minorities, linguistically diverse individuals, indigenous individuals, and individuals residing in rural areas.}

We analyze data from a survey of commuters in the city of Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Concretely, we are interested in cycling and walking. A probabilistic model of mode use is estimated using disaggregate data collected in Rajshahi through a face-to-face survey in 2017. The study reveals that similar to other regions in the world, students are more likely to use active transportation compared to other socio-demographic groups, and that motorized vehicle ownership is associated with lower probabilities of active transportation. Furthermore, the probabilities of choosing active modes at different neighborhood-level conditions were calculated based on the derived model for both students and non-students by residential and non-residential land-use types. In addition to the duration of the trip, the perceived neighborhood-level characteristics are critical for active transportation. Improving neighborhood conditions and their perception by the public can enhance the attractiveness of active travel, more specifically cycling for longer commutes. Based on the study findings, the paper discusses strategies to promote the use of active transportation in the context of a country in the Global South.},

   abstract = {The population in developed countries is aging. Literature has paid minimal attention to the effects that population aging may have on transport demand and sustainability. These effects are believed to be more pronounced in urban areas. A policy framework is presented. It can be used as a template for the development and evaluation of policies that directly or indirectly relate to the effect of population aging on transport in urban areas and thereby inform the planning process. A component of the proposed policy development framework is an urban transport simulation model that is used to simulate policy scenarios over time. Integrated Model for Population Aging Consequences on Transportation (IMPACT) is a conventional transport simulation model coupled with a powerful demographic model that has the potential to project the population of traffic analysis zones over time, as it takes into account vital statistics (births, deaths) and migration rates. Two types of policies were investigated. The first regards elderly driver's license renewal; the second is related to new housing development policies. The results indicate that such a system can produce results that can inform policy regarding elderly automobility.},

The proposed modeling framework makes use of two components: the Rogers multiregional population projection model and the aggregate spatial multinomial logit (ASMNL) model. The Rogers model utilizes cohort vital statistics on fertility, mortality, and migration to project the progression of population by age and sex at the regional level, while the ASMNL model extends the capabilities of the Rogers model enabling it to provide population estimates at a finer spatial scale. The model is applied to the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area in Canada. Our simulation tests highlight the robustness of the proposed modeling approach in utilizing small area characteristics and regional vital statistics to perform small area population projections.},

   abstract = {Transportation systems around the world have been designed in a way that emphasizes the pre-eminence of motorized mobility, in particular the private car. This has led to the emergence of transportation monocultures, defined as systems where the ability of travelers to use various modes is constrained. In order to create transportation polycultures, alternative modes of transportation must be available and users must perceive them as feasible alternatives to the car. This implies changing the modality style (a predisposition towards certain modes) and increasing the modality (number of alternatives available and feasible for use) of travelers. The objective of this paper is to investigate the modality of respondents to a travel survey in McMaster University, Canada. We define modality as the self-reported number of modes that respondents consider available/feasible for their daily commute, including the chosen mode. Analysis is based on the application of an ordered probit model. The results of our study indicate that modality is influenced by a combination of demographic, attitudinal and spatial/land use variables. With respect to mode of travel, active travelers tend to have a higher modality compared to users of motorized modes. Car users who live in more densely built environments are more likely to report higher levels of modality, whereas density reduces the modality of users of local transit. Distance from McMaster reduces the modality of car and local transit users. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Identification of suitable instruments is a critical step for the implementation of instrumental variable (IV) estimation. A challenge is that, as the level of correlation between the instruments and the endogenous variable increases, so also do the chances that the instruments themselves will be correlated with the error terms. Contrariwise, when the correlation with the endogenous variable is low, the instruments may be weak and perform poorly. The objective of this paper is to explore the use of synthetic variables in IV estimation when the analysis is of spatial data series. The point of departure is the use of eigenvector analysis of the usual spatial weights matrix used in spatial statistics. Eigenvectors obtained from a transformed weights matrix are known to represent latent map patterns. Our proposal is to use these patterns to obtain synthetic variables for use as instruments in IV estimation. By their very nature, instruments based on synthetic variables are exogenous. Furthermore, they can provide relatively high levels of correlation with the endogenous variable. In this paper we consider two situations of interest: first, the case where there are no clear candidates for instrumentation and the instruments are comprised of purely synthetic variables; second, the case when there are substantive but weak instruments that can be enhanced by the addition of synthetic variables. The approach proposed is illustrated with an empirical example.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Subjective wellbeing is a topic that has attracted considerable attention in the transportation literature in recent years. As a result, there is a burgeoning literature that investigates the impacts of travel on subjective wellbeing, and how wellbeing, in turn, can influence behavior. An important aspect of subjective wellbeing are the affective reactions of people to their experiences. Objective: The objective of this paper is to analyze the affective reactions of travelers with respect to various modes of transportation. In particular, we are interested in the potential for dissonance between primary mode of travel and the mode(s) of travel identified as evoking various affective reactions. Materials and methods: The study is based on data collected from a sample of travelers in the city of Santiago, in Chile. Participants in the study were asked about their usual mode of travel, and then were asked to name their ideal mode(s) of transportation from the perspective of various affective reactions. The reactions we investigate are associated with the values of Freedom, Enjoyment, Happiness, Poverty, Luxury, and Status. Analysis is based on tests of independence and visualization techniques. Results: The results indicate that users of public transportation experience the most dissonance in terms of affective reactions, and active travelers the least. For those travelers who experience dissonance, active travel is the mode most commonly associated with Freedom, Enjoyment, and Happiness, while public transportation is most commonly associated with Poverty. The automobile, in contrast, is the mode most commonly associated with Luxury and Status.},

Using a particular counterexample, he shows that the asymptotic distribution of the SG(m) test may be far from the Chi-square family; the property of consistency is also questioned. In this note, the authors want to clarify the properties of the SG(m) test. We argue that the cause of the conflict is in the specification of the symbolization map. The discrepancies can be solved by adjusting some of the definitions made in the original paper. Moreover, we introduce a permutational bootstrapped version of the SG(m) test, which is powerful and robust to the underlying statistical assumptions.

The objective of this study is to investigate the spatial clustering of high-tech and knowledge-intensive firms in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada. We do this by means of the use of a spatial scan statistic. Application of this statistic leads us to conjecture that accessibility to transportation infrastructure and skilled labour contribute to the formation of industrial clusters in these sectors. Our conjecture is borne by a set of logit models that identify these two factors as significantly contributing to cluster membership.},

   abstract = {Infrastructure networks, including transportation, telecommunications, and energy grids, are essential for the correct functioning of many economic and social processes. Considering the import of networked critical infrastructure, it is clear that understanding the characteristics of networks that make them vulnerable to disruption is a valuable endeavor. As recent research demonstrates, network vulnerability is a very relevant issue on the design and operation of any networked process in general, and transportation in particular, where the main interest is on identifying network elements that are singularly sensible to disruptions to their integrity. While there have been some suggestions from the literature that the configuration of the network may influence the vulnerability of individual elements, a systematic investigation of network topology and vulnerability has not been conducted. Furthermore, neither has there been an account of the relevance of coherence in the contents of the network, or in other words, the autocorrelation of flows. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to investigate, from the perspective of the integrity of nodes, the vulnerability to disruption of individual network elements, while controlling for network topology and autocorrelation. Analysis is based on extensive numerical simulations for different network configurations and spatial autocorrelation levels, and the results obtained demonstrate that the proper evaluation of network vulnerability requires not only an understanding of its topology, but also of the distribution of flows.

   abstract = {Recent advancements in computing and geographic information systems (GIS) have revolutionized the development of planning support systems (PSSs) to study and simulate the future of travel demand in urban areas. While travel demand models have been widely developed and used to inform the urban planning process, very little has been done to explicitly account for demographic changes and the ageing of population within such models. The work in this paper bridges this gap by describing the development and application of IMPACT (integrated model for population ageing consequences on transportation), a GIS-based PSS capable of assessing the ramifications of demographic changes, including population ageing, on the performance and usage of urban transportation systems. Unlike existing operational PSSs, IMPACT possesses unique and novel features that enable it to model demographic changes and urban travel demand for various age cohorts. Through the simulation of scenarios for varying fertility rates, the paper explores and quantifies the impacts of ageing and population age-structure changes on travel Patterns in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Hamilton in Ontario, Canada. The analysis suggests a consistent increase in the number of trips and mobility levels of elderly drivers, as a result of population ageing over time. Furthermore, increases in fertility rates could significantly impact the usage and performance of the transportation system for certain periods of the day, by the year 2031. Results such as these are important to consider when planning the future of cities. The findings in this paper provide new insights into the future of urban travel in the Canadian context.

   abstract = {The transportation impacts of an increasingly urban population have led planners and policy makers to consider ways to encourage the use of active travel in urban areas. Active travel is attractive from a planning perspective because its environmental impact is considerably lower than the alternatives, and in addition is known to have a number of population health and social benefits. Not surprisingly, there has been a growth in interest in the factors associated with the use of active modes of transportation. The objective of this study is to investigate the individual (demographic and socio-economic) and contextual (geography and land use type) factors that correlate with the propensity to travel by active modes in Vitoria-Gasteiz. This is a medium sized city in the north of Spain, and a case study that has hitherto not been reported. Data obtained from a household travel survey (HTS) conducted in 2014 allow us to estimate a multinomial logit model of the propensity to travel by different modes of transportation. Furthermore, since the data are geocoded, we can estimate a model with spatially-varying coefficients to assess the geographical variations in the probability to use active modes. The results of the study provide valuable information concerning differences in active travel by gender and age, including significant and quite substantial variations by location. In addition, the effect of different urban fabrics indicates the relevance of density and mix of uses for active travel. In this way, the present research helps to increase our global knowledge-base regarding active travel in a medium-sized city.},

The impact of transportation facilities is highly localized as well, and it is possible that spillover effects result from the capitalization of accessibility. The objective of this study was to review the theoretical background related to spatial hedonic models and the opportunities that they provided to evaluate the effect of new transportation infrastructure. An empirical case study is presented: the Madrid Metro Line 12, known as Metrosur, in the region of Madrid, Spain. The effect of proximity to metro stations on housing prices was evaluated. The analysis took into account a host of variables, including structure, location, and neighborhood and made use of three modeling approaches: linear regression estimation with ordinary least squares, spatial error, and spatial lag. The results indicated that better accessibility to Metrosur stations had a positive impact on real estate values and that the effect was marked in cases in which a house was for sale. The results also showed the presence of submarkets, which were well defined by geographic boundaries, and transport fares, which implied that the economic benefits differed across municipalities.},

Specifically, we explore the location patterns by different industry sectors, to evaluate if the new metro line has encouraged the emergence of a "Metrosur spatial economy".

A provincial analysis, taking the case of the Province of Ontario in Canada, is warranted given that the country's highly decentralized system puts provincial policies at the forefront in meeting this challenge. The paper evaluates the important progress made in this policy area and stressed the need to go beyond the traditional policy focus on the less able-bodied elderly and consider the increased heterogeneity of the elderly population with respect to lifestyle, preferences, resources, health and physical abilities. While significant efforts have been made, a more explicit recognition of population aging in Ontario's transport policy motivation that could strongly influence transport strategies and investments attuned to the mobility concerns in an aging society remains to be seen. The paper summarizes the general concerns in the literature, policy developments, and the challenges in crafting solutions in terms of policy and research for Ontario and other regions with similar institutional setup.

The findings show important differences in the factors associated with car driving and public transit, between genders, and according to income level, educational achievement, household structure and immigration status. Furthermore, it is found that significant factors affecting travel mode use among low-income people in various urban areas are differentiated by province. The results point towards a geographic-based and balanced promotion of public and private mobility programmes and policies to address transport needs of low-income workers.},

However, we know very little about whether walkable neighborhoods promote walking among older adults, particularly those with lower incomes. Therefore in this paper we: (i) examine the relation between trip distance and socio-demographic attributes and accessibility features of lower income older adults in Metro Vancouver; and, (ii) implement a web-based application to calculate the accessibility of lower income older adults in Metro Vancouver based on their travel behavior. We use multilevel linear regression to estimate the determinants of trip length. We find that in this population distance traveled is associated with gender, living arrangements, and dog ownership. Furthermore, significant geographical variations (measured using a trend surface) were also found. To better visualize the impact of travel behavior on accessibility by personal profile and location, we also implemented a web-based calculator that generates an Accessibility (A)-score using Google Maps API v3 that can be used to evaluate the accessibility of neighborhoods from the perspective of older adults.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the implications of accessibility to transit and by transit for mode shares in the city of Hamilton, Canada. We model transit shares by means of a logistic regression that takes into account over-dispersion and spatial autocorrelation. The results of the final model indicate that accessibility by transit is a significant predictor of modal share in our case study. Technically, our analysis clearly illustrates that ignoring over-dispersion and autocorrelation can result in misleading inference and erroneous policy prescriptions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Walkability audits provide valuable information about pedestrian environments, but are time-consuming and can be expensive to implement. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to select sites for conducting walkability audits. The key idea is to estimate a model of travel behavior at the meso-scale level, which can be examined to identify locations where the behavior is under- and over-estimated. We conjecture that systematic under- and over-estimation can be caused by micro-level factors that influence the behavior. The results can be used to identify sites for walkability audits. The approach is demonstrated with a case study in Hamilton, Canada. A model of walk shares forms the basis of the site selection procedure. After identifying areas with higher and lower shares than predicted by the model we select a sample of neighborhoods for audits. Analysis of the results reveals elements of the local environment that associate with greater-than-expected walk shares. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model-based strategy can be used to better target limited resources, and produce valuable insights into micro-level factors that affect travel behavior.

   abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the attributes of walkable environments from the perspective of seniors in the Island of Montreal in Quebec, Canada. The research is based on a combination of statistical analysis of travel diary data and field work to conduct walkability audits. The approach follows a sequence of logical steps. The first step involves the estimation of a travel behavior model walking by seniors (people 65 years or older). The results of this model, in combination with cluster analysis, are used to identify sites where the model systematically under- or over-predicts walking. Subsequently, sites are targeted for walkability audits. It then becomes possible to assess the presence or absence of attributes of built environments where walking is more or less common than other factors would predict. A walkability audit of 403 street segments was used to proof the concept in this paper. The audited items were summarized in contingency tables and tested with the chi-squared test of independence to identify streetscape elements that correlate with walking for transportation.

   abstract = {Rapid demographic aging in countries around the world has prompted an interest in understanding the mobility patterns of seniors. While much research has been conducted in terms of motorized modes, the promotion of healthy aging argues for new research to investigate the multi-modal travel behavior of seniors including active travel. The objective of this paper is to investigate the factors that influence the use of two motorized and one active mode of transportation, and their corresponding trip length. A joint discrete-continuous modeling framework allows us to examine the tendency to travel by different modes using a multinomial structure, and trip length using a hazard formulation. Data are drawn from Montreal's Household Travel Survey of 2008. A broad array of covariates related to individual and household attributes and urban form are used. The results of the analysis reveal a significant degree of geographical variability in the travel behavior of seniors in Montreal. In particular, estimates for seniors with different socio-economic and demographic profiles show substantial intra-urban variability in walking behavior, and the role of neighborhood design attributes in influencing the mobility of seniors.

   abstract = {Background: Walking for transport is increasingly considered an important component for meeting physical activity guidelines. This is true for individuals of all ages, and particularly important for seniors, for whom other physical activities may not be recommended. In order to evaluate the potential contributions of walking to physical activity, in this paper the concept of Compliance Potential Mapping is introduced. The concept is illustrated using seniors as a case study. Methods: Based on estimates of walking trip distance and frequency, estimates of expected total daily walking distance are obtained. These estimates are converted to weekly walking minutes, which are in turn compared to recommended physical activity guidelines for seniors. Once estimates of travel behavior are available, the approach is straightforward and based on relatively simple map algebra operations. Results: Compliance Potential Mapping as a tool to assess the potential contributions of walking towards physical activity is demonstrated using data from Montreal's 2008 travel survey. The results indicate that the central parts of Montreal Island display higher potential for compliance with physical activity guidelines, but with variations according to age, income, occupation, possession of driver's license and vehicle, and neighborhood and accessibility parameters. Conclusions: Compliance Potential Maps offer valuable information for public health and transportation planning and policy analysis.},

Most attention in the field of transportation has been devoted to motorized travel. However, the use of various modes of transportation, including nonmotorized travel, remains to be fully investigated. In this paper the multimodal trip generation of seniors in Montreal Island is studied. Personal, mobility tools, neighborhood, and accessibility variables are considered in a trivariate ordered probit model of three modes: car, transit, and walking. Geographical analysis of the walking component of the model helps to identify locations within the region where walking is more or less prevalent among older adults.},

   abstract = {A vast majority of the recent literature on spatial hedonic analysis has been concerned with residential property values, with only very few examples of studies focused on commercial property prices. The dearth of studies can be attributed to some of the challenges faced in the analysis of commercial properties, in particular the scarcity of information compared to residential transactions. In order to address this issue, in this paper we propose the use of cokriging and housing prices as ancillary information to estimate commercial property prices. Cokriging takes into account the spatial autocorrelation structure of property prices, and the use of more abundant information on housing prices helps to improve the accuracy of property value estimates. A case study of Toledo in Spain, a city for which commercial activity stemming from tourism is one of the key elements of the economy in the city, demonstrates that substantial accuracy and precision gains can be obtained from the use of cokriging.},

Data obtained for three large urban centers - Hamilton, Toronto, and Montreal - are analyzed using spatial expansion models, a technique used to obtain spatially-varying coefficients that help to tease out contextual person-location variations in travel behavior. Detailed geographical results help to enhance our understanding of the spatiality of travel behavior of the population segments of interest. Substantively, the results provide evidence of significant interactions between location, various demographic factors, and mobility tools. More specifically, the results evince patterns of mobility that are significantly different from the mainstream population, particularly in suburban settings, in ways that are indicative of mobility challenges.

   abstract = {Gender differentials in commuting have been reported in the literature, often couched within the household responsibility hypothesis. This hypothesis attributes shorter commutes to females due to a disproportionate load of household responsibilities. The objective of the present study is to report research regarding commuting time in SAo Paulo Metropolitan Region, in Brazil. Based on microdata from the Demographic Census of 2010 the focus of the present study is on the role of marital status and presence of dependents on gender differentials in commuting time. Specifically, the research seeks to determine whether there is empirical support in this region for the household responsibility hypothesis. The results suggest that marital status exerts a stronger influence on the commuting time of working women, with the number of dependents (children and elderly) exerting a smaller influence on commuting time. Gender differentials are observed also for single and formerly married working females, which suggests other cultural or environmental factors not fully captured by the household responsibility hypothesis. Most studies, however, are set in North America. This research contributes towards the development of a broader, international knowledge foundation regarding gender and commuting patterns.},

   abstract = {Most standard methods of statistical analysis used in the social and environmental sciences are built upon the basic assumptions of independence, homogeneity, and isotropy. A notable exception to this rule is the collection of methods used in geographical analysis, which have been designed to take into account serial dependence often observed in spatial data. In addition, recent developments, in particular the method of geographically weighted regression, have provided the tools to model non-stationary processes, and thus evidence that challenges the assumption of homogeneity. The assumption of isotropy, however although suspect, has received considerably less attention, and there is thus a need for tools to study anisotropy in a more systematic fashion. In this paper we expand the method of geographically weighted regression in a simple yet effective way to explore the topic of anisotropy in spatial processes. We discuss two different estimation situations and exemplify the proposed technical development by means of a case study. The results suggest that anisotropy issues might be a fairly common occurrence in spatial processes and/or in the statistical modeling of spatial processes.},

   abstract = {The continued integration of international economies is an unfolding process that has accelerated in recent years and that is believed to have the potential to impact on the structure of the spatial economy. The process is of interest from the viewpoint of the transport scholar, because a relevant question is whether, and if so to what extent, the economic changes implied by integration can be guided and influenced by transport infrastructure and services. A number of studies have been conducted, in particular in a European setting, that examine the potential links between accessibility and economic activity. The objective of this paper is to analyse the relationship between intermodal network accessibility and the spatial distribution of economic activities in an east Asian setting. To this end, a multivariate framework based on the use of spatial statistical models is proposed that furthers the methodological possibilities of accessibility analysis. The empirical findings suggest that, once contextual factors are considered, the influence of accessibility as an explanatory factor of the spatial distribution of economic activity in the region becomes very much diminished.},

GWR is a simple, yet conceptually appealing approach for exploring spatial non-stationarity that has been described as a natural evolution of the expansion method. The objective of the present paper is to compare, by means of a simulation exercise, these two local forms of spatial analysis. Motivation for the exercise derives from two basic research questions: Is spatial non-stationarity in GWR an artifact of the way the model is calibrated? And, how well does GWR capture spatial variability? The results suggest that, on average, spatial variability in GWR is not a consequence of the calibration procedure, and that GWR is sufficiently flexible to reproduce the type of map patterns used in the simulation experiment.},

In some cases, where the assumption of constant relationships is questionable, market segmentation procedures are used to study varying relationships. More recently, methodological developments, and a greater awareness of the importance of geography, have led to increasingly sophisticated ways to explore varying relationships in land use and transportation modeling. The objective of this paper is to propose a simple probit model to explore contextual variability in continuous-space. Some conceptual and technical issues are discussed, and an example is presented that reanalyzes land use change using data from California's BART system. The results of the example suggest that considerable parametric variation exists across geographical space, and thus underlines the relevance of contextual effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, elemental symbol mapping and spatial association analysis techniques are applied to travelers' attitudes. Attitudinal data, drawn from a recent travel survey conducted in McMaster University (Hamilton, Canada) among staff, students, and faculty, are analyzed. The place of residence of the respondents is geocoded in order to map the responses, and the spatial pattern of the qualitative/ordinal attitudinal variables is analyzed using the Q(m) statistic. Analysis of a selection of variables shows how some attitudes appear to develop independently from the local environments, whereas others are related to a preference towards certain types of local environments or social aspects of the local environment, which suggests underlying processes of self-selection or adaptation.

   abstract = {Residual spatial autocorrelation is a situation frequently encountered in regression analysis of spatial data. The statistical problems arising due to this phenomenon are well-understood. Original developments in the field of statistical analysis of spatial data were meant to detect spatial pattern, in order to assess whether corrective measures were required. An early development was the use of residual autocorrelation as an exploratory tool to improve regression analysis of spatial data. In this note, we propose the use of spatial filtering and exploratory data analysis as a way to identify omitted but potentially relevant independent variables. We use an example of blood donation patterns in Toronto, Canada, to demonstrate the proposed approach. In particular, we show how an initial filter used to rectify autocorrelation problems can be progressively replaced by substantive variables. In the present case, the variables so retrieved reveal the impact of urban form, travel habits, and demographic and socio-economic attributes on donation rates. The approach is particularly appealing for model formulations that do not easily accommodate positive spatial autocorrelation, but should be of interest as well for the case of continuous variables in linear regression.},

   abstract = {Accessibility is a widely used concept in transportation planning and research. However a majority of the literature is concerned with accessibility in infrastructure-rich regions where it is used to assess the output of infrastructure. Relatively scant attention in contrast has been paid to the topic of accessibility in infrastructure-poor regions. These are regions characterized by non-homogeneous landscapes with limited or no transportation infrastructure. Even studies that deal with infrastructure-poor regions tend to transpose the methods used elsewhere. This practice seems inappropriate when mobility happens by active rather than motorized modes since the effort required for movement is likely different. The objective of this paper is to compare distance, time, and metabolic energy cost functions in walking accessibility. To this end, we present a case study of accessibility to water in central Kenya. The results indicate that Euclidean distance, surface distance, and travel time correlate better between them than any of them does with metabolic energy. Furthermore, while shortest paths tend to be symmetric for distance and time criteria, under consideration of metabolic energy expenditure pathways change significantly depending on the direction of movement. This has implications for measuring accessibility and equity. By providing alternate mechanisms for valuing the cost of movement, this research suggests avenues to consider vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women who require greater nutritional intake and expend more energy per unit activity. Directions for further research include certain trade-offs between route choice variables across various applications, for example, walking and cycling route choice algorithms.},

   abstract = {An important goal for blood agencies, especially in the context of aging populations, is to ensure the sufficiency of the blood supply. Of the eligible population, only a small proportion donates. A question therefore is how to expand the donor base. Previous research has shown that accessibility to clinics positively associates with donor turnout. Since accessibility depends on the allocation of resources to clinic sites it provides a policy handle to facilitate donor participation. Generation and examination of clinic accessibility landscapes can be part of a strategy to increase donor turnout. The research uses donor and clinic databases provided by Canadian Blood Services for calendar year 2008. Donor numbers were aggregated at the level of Dissemination Areas for the city of Toronto, Canada, and complemented with socio-economic and demographic information from the Census. Multivariate statistical analysis confirms the positive association between number of donors and accessibility, calculated using a two-step floating approach. The model becomes the objective function in a heuristic search procedure (genetic algorithms) to investigate the potential effect on donor turnout of allocation of resources to clinics. The results of the analysis indicate that the current number of donors is at the lower end of the range of solutions obtained from generating accessibility landscapes. Gains in the total number of estimated donors range between 1% and 22%. An advantage of generating several solutions is the possibility of examining the magnitude of change required, in terms of the (re-)allocation of resources to clinics. Detailed examination of the results can assist decision-makers to evaluate the trade-offs between the magnitude of the change required and the potential payoff. Given current trends, there is a need for planning to ensure that the supply of blood is sufficient. Even small gains can make an important difference between a sufficient blood supply and shortages. The approach presented here to generate clinic accessibility landscapes constitutes a useful tool for blood agencies to explore scenarios for increasing their donor base. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Currently, however, relatively little is known about the extent to which Canadians with disabilities are able to exercise of this right. Previous research has investigated the employment status and commute distance of persons with disabilities in Canada. In this paper, we use the 2006 Participation and Activity Limitation Survey to investigate, from the perspective of Canadian adults with disabilities, the factors that influence (1) their frequency of participation in various leisure and recreation activities; (2) the role of transportation in activity participation; and (3) the desire for more leisure and recreation activities during spare time. The latter question is closely associated to the experience of exclusion. The results of the analysis indicate that some of the very factors that tend to reduce participation also relate to a desire for more leisure and recreation activities.},

This is an issue that poses a serious challenge for the utility of the method as a tool to investigate multivariate relationships. The objectives of this paper are to assess: (1) the ability of GWR to discriminate between a spatially constant processes and one with spatially varying relationships; and (2) to accurately retrieve spatially varying relationships. Extensive numerical experiments are used to investigate situations where the underlying process is stationary and nonstationary, and to assess the degree to which spurious intercoefficient correlations are introduced. Two different implementations of GWR and cross-validation approaches are assessed. Results suggest that judicious application of GWR can be used to discern whether the underlying process is nonstationary. Furthermore, evidence of spurious correlations indicates that caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions regarding spatial relationships retrieved using this approach, particularly when working with small samples.},

   abstract = {Road crashes impose an important burden on health and the economy. Numerous efforts have been undertaken to understand the factors that affect road collisions in general, and the severity of crashes in particular. In this literature several strategies have been proposed to model interactions between parties in a crash, including the use of variables regarding the other party (or parties) in the collision, data subsetting, and estimating models with hierarchical components. Since no systematic assessment has been conducted of the performance of these strategies, they appear to be used in an ad-hoc fashion in the literature. The objective of this paper is to empirically evaluate ways to model party interactions in the context of crashes involving two parties. To this end, a series of models are estimated using data from Canada's National Collision Database. Three levels of crash severity (no injury/injury/fatality) are analyzed using ordered probit models and covariates for the parties in the crash and the conditions of the crash. The models are assessed using predicted shares and classes of outcomes, and the results highlight the importance of considering opponent effects in crash severity analysis. The study also suggests that hierarchical (i.e., multi-level) specifications and subsetting do not necessarily perform better than a relatively simple single-level model with opponent-related factors. The results of this study provide insights regarding the performance of different modelling strategies, and should be informative to researchers in the field of crash severity.},

   abstract = {Floating Catchment Area (FCA) methods are a popular tool to investigate accessibility to public facilities, in particular health care services. FCA approaches are attractive because, unlike other accessibility measures, they take into account the potential for congestion of facilities. This is done by 1) considering the population within the catchment area of a facility to calculate a variable that measures level of service, and then 2) aggregating the level of service by population centers subject to catchment area constraints. In this paper we discuss an effect of FCA approaches, an artifact that we term demand and level of service inflation. These artifacts are present in previous implementations of FCA methods. We argue that inflation makes interpretation of estimates of accessibility difficult, which has possible deleterious consequences for decision making. Next, we propose a simple and intuitive approach to proportionally allocate demandand and level of service in FCA calculations. The approach is based on a standardization of the impedance matrix, similar to approaches popular in the spatial statistics and econometrics literature. The result is a more intiuitive measure of accessibility that 1) provides a local version of the provider-to-population ratio; and 2) preserves the level of demand and the level of supply in a system. We illustrate the relevant issues with some examples, and then empirically by means of a case study of accessibility to family physicians in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that demand and supply inflation/deflation affect the interpretation of accessibility analysis using existing FCA methods, and that the proposed adjustment can lead to more intuitive results.},

It seems appropriate, as the number of applications grows, to evaluate the relative ability of some newer approaches in terms of producing accurate spatial predictions. This article compares a selection of techniques to assess their performance. The focus is on moving window approaches that can be conceptualised as sliding neighbourhoods (i.e. soft market segmentations) and that can incorporate spatial dependency effects. Comparison of moving windows regression (MWR), geographically weighted regression (GWR) and moving windows Kriging (MWK) sheds light on the relevance of different spatial effects. Results using Toronto as a case study indicate that market segmentation may be more important than spatial dependencies. The findings suggest practical guidelines with regard to the use of the models investigated.},

   abstract = {Decision Trees (DTs) are a machine learning technique widely used for regression and classification purposes. Conventionally, the decision boundaries of Decision Trees are orthogonal to the features under consideration. A well-known limitation of this is that the algorithm may fail to find optimal partitions, or in some cases any partitions at all, depending on the underlying distribution of the data. To remedy this limitation, several modifications have been proposed that allow for oblique decision boundaries. The objective of this paper is to propose a new strategy for generating flexible decision boundaries by means of interactive basis functions (IBFs). We show how oblique decision boundaries can be obtained as a particular case of IBFs, and in addition how non-linear decision boundaries can be induced. One attractive aspect of the strategy proposed in this paper is that training Decision Trees with IBFs does not require custom software, since the functions can be precalculated for use in any existing implementation of the algorithm. Since the underlying mechanisms remain unchanged there is no substantial computational overhead compared to conventional trees. Furthermore, this also means that IBFs can be used in any extensions of the Decision Tree algorithm, such as evolutionary trees, boosting, and bagging. We conduct a benchmarking exercise to understand under which conditions the use of IBFs can improve model the performance. In addition, we present three empirical applications that illustrate the approach in classification and regression. As part of discussing the empirical applications, we introduce a device called decision charts to facilitate the interpretation of DTs with IBFs. Finally, we conclude the paper by outlining some directions for future research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The novel SARS-CoV2 has disrupted health systems and the economy, and public health interventions to slow its spread have been costly. How and when to ease restrictions to movement hinges in part on whether SARS-CoV2 will display seasonality due to variations in temperature, humidity, and hours of sunshine. Here, we address this question by means of a spatio-temporal analysis in Spain of the incidence of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Use of spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) allows us to model the incidence of reported cases of the disease per 100,000 population as an interregional contagion process, in addition to a function of temperature, humidity, and sunshine. In the analysis we also control for GDP per capita, percentage of older adults in the population, population density, and presence of mass transit systems. The results support the hypothesis that incidence of the disease is lower at higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity. Sunshine, in contrast, displays a positive association with incidence of the disease. Our control variables also yield interesting insights. Higher incidence is associated with higher GDP per capita and presence of mass transit systems in the province; in contrast, population density and percentage of older adults display negative associations with incidence of COVID-19.},

   abstract = {Discrete choice models are increasingly implemented using geographical data. When this is the case, it may not be sufficient to project market shares accurately, but also to correctly replicate the spatial pattern of choices. Analysts might then be interested in assessing the results of a model's fit relative to the spatial distribution of the observed responses. While canonical approaches exist for the exploratory spatial analysis of continuous variables, similar tools have not been widely implemented for discrete choice models, where the variable of interest is categorical. For this reason, despite recent progress with spatial models for discrete outcomes, there is still not a simple and intuitive tool to assess the quality of the spatial fit of a discrete choice model. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new indicator of spatial fit that can be applied to the results of discrete choice models. Utility of the indicator is explored by means of numerical experiments and then demonstrated by means of a case study of vehicle ownership in Montreal, Canada. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Background: Geographical access to health care facilities is known to influence health services usage. As societies age, accessibility to health care becomes an increasingly acute public health concern. It is known that seniors tend to have lower mobility levels, and it is possible that this may negatively affect their ability to reach facilities and services. Therefore, it becomes important to examine the mobility situation of seniors vis-a-vis the spatial distribution of health care facilities, to identify areas where accessibility is low and interventions may be required. Methods: Accessibility is implemented using a cumulative opportunities measure. Instead of assuming a fixed bandwidth (i.e. a distance threshold) for measuring accessibility, in this paper the bandwidth is defined using model-based estimates of average trip length. Average trip length is an all-purpose indicator of individual mobility and geographical reach. Adoption of a spatial modelling approach allows us to tailor these estimates of travel behaviour to specific locations and person profiles. Replacing a fixed bandwidth with these estimates permits us to calculate customized location-and person-based accessibility measures that allow inter-personal as well as geographical comparisons. Data: The case study is Montreal Island. Geo-coded travel behaviour data, specifically average trip length, and relevant traveller's attributes are obtained from the Montreal Household Travel Survey. These data are complemented with information from the Census. Health care facilities, also geo-coded, are extracted from a comprehensive business point database. Health care facilities are selected based on Standard Industrial Classification codes 8011-21 (Medical Doctors and Dentists). Results: Model-based estimates of average trip length show that travel behaviour varies widely across space. With the exception of seniors in the downtown area, older residents of Montreal Island tend to be significantly less mobile than people of other age cohorts. The combination of average trip length estimates with the spatial distribution of health care facilities indicates that despite being more mobile, suburban residents tend to have lower levels of accessibility compared to central city residents. The effect is more marked for seniors. Furthermore, the results indicate that accessibility calculated using a fixed bandwidth would produce patterns of exposure to health care facilities that would be difficult to achieve for suburban seniors given actual mobility patterns. Conclusions: The analysis shows large disparities in accessibility between seniors and non-seniors, between urban and suburban seniors, and between vehicle owning and non-owning seniors. This research was concerned with potential accessibility levels. Follow up research could consider the results reported here to select case studies of actual access and usage of health care facilities, and related health outcomes.},

   abstract = {Accessibility research, within the context of the social exclusion dimensions of transport, has provided valuable tools to understand the potential of people to reach daily life activity locations. In this paper, model-based estimates of distance travelled are used to calculate a cumulative opportunities measure of accessibility. Multivariate, spatially expanded models produce estimates of distance travelled that are specific to both geographical location and type of individual. Opportunity landscapes obtained based on these estimates are used for comparative accessibility analysis by means of what are termed relative accessibility deprivation indicators. The indicators proposed are demonstrated with a case study of food deserts in the city of Montreal, Canada. The results of the analysis illustrate the variations in accessibility between individuals in low-income households and the reference group, and the effect of vehicle ownership for accessibility to food services, thus highlighting the social exclusion implications of these factors.},

   abstract = {A mixture of modes is considered a key element towards sustainable transportation. New technologies that provide information about various modes and environments can help to inform choices regarding travel and accessibility. In this paper we describe the development of a web-based accessibility calculator prototype for the Greater Montreal Area in Canada. The core of this tool is a statistical model of trip length developed using the spatial expansion method. The model is used to obtain estimates of trip length for a desired profile, based on attributes such as age, gender, family structure, and mode of travel, as well as geographical location. These estimates are used to calculate a cumulative opportunities accessibility measure to different types of essential destinations. Travel behavior information is drawn from Montreal's 2008 Household Travel Surveys. Geocoded information about trip origins and destinations is used to calculate trip length. A broad array of covariates related to individual and household attributes, and urban form are used. A geocoded business point database is used for the calculation of cumulative opportunities. To simplify the use of the accessibility calculator, the model is implemented in a user-friendly way using Google Maps API v3 and a convenient interface. Different possible uses of the accessibility calculator are illustrated in the paper. The accessibility calculator can be used by members of the public or planners/policy makers to measure the level of accessibility for a specific address and personal profile by various modes of transportation.

An important part of this literature is concerned with the identification and measurement of segregation patterns. Recently, emphatic calls have been made to develop measures that are better able to capture the geography of population patterns. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the application of the Q statistic, developed for the analysis of spatial association of qualitative variables, to the detection of ethnic clustering and exposure patterns. The application is to historical data from 1880 Newark in the United States, with individuals classified by ethnicity and geocoded by place of residence. Three ethnic groups, termed Irish, Germans, and Yankees, are considered. Exploratory analysis with the Q statistic identifies significant differences in the tendency of individuals and building occupancy to cluster by ethnicity. In particular, there is evidence of a strong affinity within ethnic clusters and some intermingling between Yankee and Irish residents. In contrast, the exposure of Germans to individuals of other groups is found to be more limited.},

The focus of this paper is on the topic of elderly trip generation and the development of models to help formalise some important relationships between trip-making behaviour and personal, household and contextual variables (such as location). The case study is the Hamilton Metropolitan Area-an important functional component of Greater Toronto, itself one of the regions in Canada where the impact of ageing is expected to be most strongly felt. Using data from Toronto's Transport Tomorrow Survey and mixed ordered probit models, the study investigates the question of spatial and demographic variability in trip-making behaviour. The results support the proposition that trip-making propensity decreases with age. However, it is also found that this behaviour is not spatially homogeneous and in fact exhibits a large degree of variability-a finding that highlights both the challenges of planning transport for the elderly and the potential of spatial analytical approaches to improve transport modelling practice.},

Drawing upon the theory of externalities and the sociological notion of social networks, we develop a discrete choice model that incorporates elements of social influence in addition to more conventional factors such as the attributes of alternatives and the characteristics of decisionmakers. Using simulation, we apply the model to the case of telecommuting-that is, the decision to telecommute or not-over two waves. The experiment suggests that some marginal adopters of telecommuting are influenced heavily in the second wave by the decisions of others in the first wave. Furthermore, the example illustrates the importance of social influence on new adopters of telecommuting in the second wave.},

A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.

Models of this type are applied extensively to the study of travel behavior, residential location, and employment decisions, among other topics of interest. A notable characteristic of the underlying economic theory is the assumption that individuals seek to maximize utility on the basis of their personal attributes and the attributes of the alternatives available to them. This approach ignores the interrelated nature of decision making in social situations-in other words, the role that social structures play in shaping behavior. In this paper we describe a multinomial discrete choice approach to analyzing individual behavior in social situations where position in a social network may encourage or discourage different courses of action.

The objective of this paper is to investigate a key topic that has received relatively little attention in previous research, namely the issues that arise when observational limitations lead to measurement errors in these weight matrices. Measurement errors are investigated from two perspectives: when relevant ties are omitted, and when irrelevant ties are erroneously included as part of the matrix. The paper first shows analytically that these two situations result in biased estimates. Next, a simulation experiment provides evidence of the effect of erroneously coding the weight matrix on model performance and the ability of a network autocorrelation test to identify social influence effects. The results suggest that depending on the level of autocorrelation and the topology attributes of the underlying matrix, there is a window of opportunity to identify and model social influence processes even in situations where the ties in a matrix cannot be accurately observed.

   abstract = {Smart card automated fare payment systems are being adopted by transit agencies around the world. The data-storage characteristics of smart cards present novel opportunities to enhance transit services. On the one hand, there are fare policies, where smart card holders are given specific rebates on the use of the service based on usage patterns or levels. On the other, there are non-fare policies, for instance if holders receive advantages, such as rebates and offers, from commercial partners. The purpose of this paper is to present a geodemographic framework to identify potential commercial partnerships that could exploit the characteristics of smart cards. The framework is demonstrated using data from Montreal, Canada. Household survey data, specifically trip ends, and business data points are jointly used to determine the exposure of various types of establishments to users of the Montreal Metro network. Spatial analysis of business establishments in the neighborhood of metro stations helps to identify potential commercial partners.

   abstract = {Transit operators face a difficult fiscal environment and an imperative to contribute to urban sustainability. Under these circumstances, operators must find innovative ways to make public transportation attractive to broader segments of the public, while simultaneously trying to raise revenue to reduce reliance on public subsidies. Development of commercial partnerships is seen as a promising way to achieve these goals. Previous research has examined the potential of using geodemographics to assist transit agencies in the task of identifying potential partners for developing mutually beneficial commercial agreements. In this paper we describe an approach to model isoexposure to transit users as a tool to assess market potential. The approach is based on the analysis of walking behavior of transit users, and specifically distance walked at the end of their transit trip. Spatial modeling is used to geographically project estimates of walking distance for a desired demographic profile at a specific transit facility. After expanding the estimates using sample weights, overlays of these estimates can be used to generate variations in exposure to transit travelers at different locations in space. The approach is demonstrated using the case of Metro users in Montreal, Canada. The case study demonstrates the use of isoexposure profiles as a novel approach to generate marketing intelligence. This should be of interest to transit agencies and businesses interested in developing partnerships. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Our model analyzes the effects of some usual land use and accessibility variables, and the magnitude of external economies affecting prices using a spatially switching autoregressive model. Using as a case study the city of Sendai in northeastern Japan (pop. about 1 million), we find considerable presence of spatial external economies, and heterogeneous effects of the price determinants between the CBD and the rest of the city.},

A concern with this kind of analysis is that often spatially associated or heterogeneous data are used, which leads to estimation pitfalls, most notably spatial autocorrelation and model structural instability over space. In this paper, we introduce a modelling methodology that combines a spatial autoregression with a switching regression to incorporate effectively both association and heterogeneity as part of the analysis. In addition, using Sendai City in north-eastern Japan as a case study, we use local statistics of spatial association to assist us in the exploration and definition of heterogeneous regimes. Finally, we show how some measures commonly used to counter spatial effects fail at times, thus highlighting the importance of a spatial modelling methodology such as the one presented here.},

   abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) has been proposed as a technique to explore spatial parametric nonstationarity. The method has been developed mainly along the lines of local regression and smoothing techniques, a strategy that has led to a number of difficult questions about the regularity conditions of the likelihood function, the effective number of degrees of freedom, and in general the relevance of extending the method to derive inference and model specification tests. In this paper we argue that placing GWR within a different statistical context, as a spatial model of error variance heterogeneity, or what might be termed locational heterogeneity, solves these difficulties. A maximum-likelihood-based framework for estimation and inference of a general geographically weighted regression model is presented that leads to a method to estimate location-specific kernel bandwidths. Moreover, a test for locational heterogeneity is derived and its use exemplified with a case study.},

In a local modeling framework, however, the issue of how to detect and model spatial association by using geographically weighted regression (GWR) remains largely unresolved. In this paper we exploit a recent development that casts GWR as a model of locational heterogeneity, to formulate a general model of spatial effects that includes as special cases GWR with a spatially lagged objective variable and GWR with spatial error autocorrelation. The approach also permits the derivation of formal tests against several forms of model misspecification, including locational heterogeneity in global models, and spatial error autocorrelation in GWR models. Application of these results is exemplified with a case study.},

   abstract = {This study investigates how socio-demographic and attitudinal variables of university students affect their desire to increase or decrease their daily commute. The case study is McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and data was obtained by means of a web-based survey that included questions regarding travel behavior, socio-demographic information, and attitudes toward travel, land use, and the environment. The objective variable is defined as the ratio of ideal to actual commute time, and regression analysis is implemented to test the relationship between this variable and socio-demographic variables and attitudinal scores. The impact of different attitudes on the gap between ideal and actual commute time is expanded to include three different modes, active travel (walk/cycle), transit, and personal automobile. Interestingly, the results indicate that active travelers tend to be less dissatisfied with their commute, followed by those who travel in a personal vehicle and transit users. A number of attitudinal responses are shown to impact the desire to travel more or less, including variables that relate to the social environment, availability of local activities, quality of facilities, productive use of the commute, and the intrinsic value found in the commute travel. The picture emerges of a traveler who would like to spend more time commuting, as someone who is an active traveler, thinks that getting there is half the fun, dislikes traveling alone, but rather likes to live in an active neighborhood where there is a sense of community. The results suggests that enjoyment of commuting, while a challenge from the perspective of motorized mobility, may provide valuable policy opportunities from the perspective of active transportation.

   abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world has raised concerns about the responsiveness of cities and healthcare systems during pandemics. Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to hospitals? response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.},

The data sources used were: (i) the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey; (ii) the 2001 Canadian Census; and (iii) the Enhanced Points of Interest (EPOI) database from the Desktop Mapping Technologies Inc. Participants were adults (>= 20 years; n = 12,836; based on a survey weight scheme N-weighted = 5,418,218) from Toronto and Vancouver census metropolitan areas with no missing BMI records. In addition to conventional 1 km-buffers, we constructed activity-space-buffers to better assess the walkability and potentially increased BMI of individuals. Multi-level analysis was then applied to estimate the relative effects of both individual-and area-level risk-factors for increased BMI. The findings demonstrate a negative association between BMI and energy expenditure, mixed land uses, residential density and average value of dwellings, while a positive association was found with low educational attainment. Relationships were independent of individual characteristics such as age and ethnicity. Although the majority of the variation in these outcomes was found to be due to individual-level differences, this study did show significant differences at the area-level as well. The activity-space-buffers presented a vast improvement compared to the conventional 1 km-buffers. The results presented support the rationale that targeting high-risk individuals will only address a portion of the increasing BMI problem; it is essential to also address the characteristics of places that compel individuals to make unhealthy choices.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach to market segmentation based on the use of machine learning techniques. Concretely, we propose a two-stage process. In the first stage, classification trees with interactive basis functions are used to identify non-orthogonal and non-linear submarket boundaries. The market segments that result are then introduced in a spatial econometric model to obtain hedonic estimates of the implicit prices of interest. The proposed approach is illustrated with a reproducible example of three major Spanish real estate markets. We conclude that identifying market sub-segments using the approach proposed is a relatively simple and demonstrate the potential of the proposed modelling strategy to produce better models and more accurate predictions.}

   abstract = {Parks are elemental components of urban landscapes that provide environmental and social function value. In particular, urban parks provide spaces for open-air physical activity. In order to enjoy the opportunities for activities in parks, users must have reasonable access to these resources. A starting point for inquiries about utilization and potential benefits of urban green spaces is an assessment of their geographical accessibility. Of particular interest, in terms of potential users of parks, are children, whose geographical range is limited by their ability to traverse space using nonmotorized modes of transportation, or by their dependence on adults for common forms of motorized mobility. The objective of this paper is to measure accessibility to urban parks from the perspective of children traveling by walking in Montreal, Canada. Implementation of accessibility measures is supported by statistical analysis of trip length using Montreal's 2008 Household Travel Surveys database. Estimates of trip length based on attributes such as age, gender, income class, family structure, as well as geographical location are used to calculate accessibility to urban parks. We evaluate the relationship between the distribution of children population and conditions of accessibility to urban parks to understand the potential for use and possible spatial disparities in the distribution of urban parks. This research contributes to the assessment of the distribution of access to urban parks by children, and can assist planners and policy makers to improve the supply of parks, while accounting for the mobility patterns of children.

   abstract = {A number of transportation infrastructure projects were conducted in Europe during the 1990s with the explicit objective of promoting regional cohesion goals through the improvement of the accessibility of peripheral regions. Given its peripheral situation in the Union, Portugal was a key target for some of these projects. A decade later, it is pertinent to ask whether the new infrastructure achieved its objective of promoting lagging regions. The objective of this paper is to analyze one of the lagging regions in Portugal, to try to establish the link between changes in accessibility levels brought by improvements in the transportation network, and two indicators commonly used in accessibility research (population and purchasing power), while controlling other variables of possible relevance, such as the levels of educational achievement of the Population in the region. The analysis is based on the use of spatially autoregressive models which allow the representation of accessibility as spatially lagged variables of first and second order. The results place the contribution of accessibility changes in context, and point at the relevance of education as an alternative policy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Open spaces improve the quality of the environment, quality of life, and promote social interaction and inclusion. There is evidence of positive impacts on health. This research analyses the potential accessibility to open spaces in two Chilean cities, Valdivia and Temuco. Analysis of accessibility is based on patterns of daily mobility by travelers while considering their trips and transport modes, in particular walking. Statistical analysis of trip length forms the basis of an adaptive threshold for the calculation of a cumulative potential measure of accessibility. The analysis shows that, for these two cities, variations in accessibility tend to be driven by age and gender, and less by income. There are also variations between the two cities, with Temuco showing better levels of accessibility, as a consequence of residents generally undertaking longer walking trips. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {To relieve road congestion, a variety of transport demand management measures (TDM) have been implemented all over the world. The success of these measures has been found to depend at least partially on users' perception about them. Several articles have jointly addressed the acceptability of public transport improvement (carrot policies) and road pricing (stick policies). However, these research works have not considered discounts on existing toll roads to relieve congestion on free alternative expressways. The objective of this paper is to study the combined acceptance of different congestion-calming policies at the suburban level, including the promotion of toll roads and measures to foster the use of transit. To that end, a survey was conducted among travelers on a commuting transport corridor in the region of Madrid aimed at exploring their perceptions towards four TDM measures, and a choice modeling framework was conducted. The scenarios considered are "carrot" policies, and the results of the analysis indicate that enhancing public transportation enjoys more support among respondents than toll promotions. Motorists using the free highway are more willing to use transit improvements than to opt for a toll road as an alternative regardless of the proposed toll discounts. Among the TDM measures explored, the least supported is the promotion of toll discounts associated with non-household carpooling. Furthermore, according to the results, the adoption of these TDM measures is more influenced by trip-related factors, in particular, the trip frequency and the mode of transport, than by socio-economic characteristics of the traveler. Finally, some geodemographic attributes of the residential location are also found to be statistically significant.},

   abstract = {Space and time planning of construction activities is a key factor affecting safety and field performance in construction sites. When scheduling and controlling linear projects, identification of potential congestion and/or idling can assist in the timely execution of a project. With the advent of location-aware technologies, it becomes possible to track availability of resources in (quasi-) real time during project execution. This provides better oversight over the movement of materials, equipment, and workforce in the jobsite. Space and time floats are currently defined and used separately in the scheduling literature. In this paper, the concept of space-time floats is proposed as a new type of float to simultaneously consider space and time constraints. Space-time floats are envelopes for all possible movement patterns that an activity or its associated resources can take considering the time and space constraints of that activity. Simultaneous consideration of space and time floats makes it possible to trade-off one for the other, which is the significance of this new float. Introduction of the space-time floats into the schedules offers new possibilities to forecast the availability of resources at a specific time and location. Use of the space-time float for each activity also enables the scheduling and control methods to forecast potential zones and times of congestion between activities and detect activity idle times as well as actual and/or potential delays. Eliminating congestions and potential risks for delays have been shown to offer considerable advantages for linear projects. Generation of space-time float for each activity in the project also helps the project team to be informed about the space and time available to them at each time and location, respectively.

It compares the mobility of these groups to that of the general population in three Canadian urban areas of Hamilton, Montreal and Toronto, based on data from large-sample metropolitan transport surveys. An ordered probit model with spatially expanded coefficients is used for the analysis. Spatial expansion shows that there are spatial mobility trends for elderly populations and low-income populations even after socio-economic attributes are accounted for. Such spatial differences are not generally found for single parent families. This novel spatial analysis provides clues as to where vulnerable populations may experience greater degrees of social exclusion. It provides information to help prioritize transportation infrastructure projects or other social programs to take into account the needs of vulnerable populations with the lowest levels of mobility.},

However, unlike the decades-worth of research devoted to the spatial association of quantitative variables, the exploratory analysis of spatial qualitative variables is relatively less developed. The objective of the present paper is to propose a new test (Q) for spatial independence. This is a simple, consistent, and powerful statistic for qualitative spatial independence that we develop using concepts from symbolic dynamics and symbolic entropy. The Q test can be used to detect, given a spatial distribution of events, patterns of spatial association of qualitative variables in a wide variety of settings. In order to enable hypothesis testing, we give a standard asymptotic distribution of an affine transformation of the symbolic entropy under the null hypothesis of independence in the spatial qualitative process. We include numerical experiments to demonstrate the finite sample behaviour of the test, and show its application by means of an empirical example that explores the spatial association of fast food establishments in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada.},

Analysis of donor data will help to identify systematic patterns of donation and its correlates. Data: Geo-coded blood donor and donor clinic data are provided by Canadian Blood Services. Blood donor data is provided for the fiscal year 2006-2007 indicating the total number of donors for each Canadian postal code, excluding the province of Quebec. Potential correlates of blood donation are selected based on social and economic characteristics, as well as descriptors of city size and geographical location in the urban hierarchy measures of accessibility, and capacity of donor clinics. Methods: Data is aggregated to n = 3,746 census tracts in 40 Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA) across the country. The number of donors per population in a census tract is regressed against the set of potential donation correlates. Autocorrelation is tested for and results adjusted to provide parsimonious models. Results: A number of factors are found to influence donation across the country, including the proportion of younger residents, English ability, proportion of people with immigrant status, higher education, and a population-based measure of accessibility. Conclusion: While a number of correlates of blood donation are observed across Canada, important contextual effects across metropolitan areas are highlighted. The paper concludes by looking at policy options that are aimed toward further understanding donor behaviour.},

To this end, we conducted a review of publications that have identified urban patterns in Brazilian cities and put forward an identification model. For the most part, we observed that the works found analyzed small areas in SÃ£o Paulo cities, using visual interpretation in private access and high spatial resolution imagery.To cover this gap, we propose a framework to identify Urban and Socio-Environmental Patterns based on remote sensing data, Voluntary Geographic Information data and census data. Although the framework can be applied in all regions of Brazil, the focus of the classification model is on Amazonian cities},

   abstract = {Accessibility is a central concept in transport geography research that has been described as a holistic measure of transportation and land use systems. This concept has numerous implementations, but virtually all share the way accessibility is measured as an attribute of pairs of origins and destinations. Borrowing from concepts in network science, in this paper we propose a new centrality measure called betweenness-accessibility. This measure couples the familiar betweenness indicator of social networks with the geographical concept of accessibility. Betweenness-accessibility is useful to estimate the impacts of accessibility on networks as potential for interaction is reflected on them. The new measure is illustrated using a reproducible example. In addition, an application to vulnerability analysis in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, provides an empirical case study to showcase the usefulness of betweenness-accessibility.},

The authors estimate stochastic frontiers to calculate regional efficiency of representative firms in 137 regions in the period 2000-2006, in four sectors defined by technological intensity. The efficiency results are analyzed using Markov Spatial Transition Matrices to provide insights into the transition of regions between efficiency levels, considering their local spatial context. The results indicate that geography plays an important role in manufacturing competitiveness. In particular, regions with more competitive neighbors are more likely to improve their relative efficiency (pull effect) over time, and regions with less competitive neighbors are more likely to lose relative efficiency (drag effect). The authors find that the pull effect is stronger than the drag effect.},

An innovative web-based telework survey was developed and used to obtain data from a sample of employees of a large postsecondary institution in Ontario, Canada, between January and March 2009. A unique feature of the survey instrument is that it allowed employees to easily construct their workplace social networks. Using a univariate (binary) probit model, we identify three mutually exclusive sources of social influence on the decision to telework: friends who telework, neighbors who telework, and colleagues at the workplace. With respect to colleagues, we find that the net impact of social influence is governed by both the composition and the size of an employee's workplace social network. Composition is captured by interacting telework status with relationship strength.},

   abstract = {Societies in many developed nations around the world are aging. Over the past decade, a growing body of research has emerged internationally in an effort to anticipate and prepare for the transport challenges posed by this unprecedented demographic change. This paper contributes to this line of research by offering new insights into senior travel behavior focusing on the recent Canadian experience. Using weekday data from the 1992 and 2005 General Social Surveys on time use, changes in the number of trips, the duration of trips, trip mode, and trip timing are evaluated for urban seniors. In contrast to the experiences of many other developed nations, analysis of the first three indicators of behavioral change refutes the notion that "automobility" has increased in Canada over the 13-year period. While this finding is encouraging, it is tempered by the fact that Canadian seniors who choose to travel by car are doing so increasingly during the morning and evening peak periods. The results from a peak versus non-peak departure-time model that pools data from both years offer important insights into factors driving this change. For instance, the results suggest that the propensity to start a trip during rush hour has increased over time for non-work trip purposes.},

   abstract = {This paper investigates stakeholderâs perspectives about freight congestion in Canadaâs major metropolitan regions. Interviews with 28 Canadian stakeholders from different sectors are analyzed using Strauss/Corbin extended approach of symbolic interactionism with the objective of producing an explanatory theory to identify barriers to freight in Canada. By integrating emergent categories with a structured framework of theoretical propositions, we are able to offer insights to understand the perceived barriers to goods movement in the Canadian landscape, as well as to detail a framework of interventions to improve freight mobility. In total, 50 themes emerged as barriers to the movement of goods, which were grouped into nine subcategories, and four overarching categories which broadly frame the issues of goods movements as relating to high infrastructure utilization (Infrastructure Demand Outstripping Supply), the cost impacts of diminishing reliability of distribution (Physical Distribution Headwinds Impeding Commerce), rapidly growing regions and ineffective or absent policy support (Urgent Regulatory Encumbrances), and a lack of a robust data collection, analysis, and information sharing framework (Information and Data Management Complexities). These categories were considered in the frame of addressing goods movement barriers and were argued to be influenced by factors of cost, political risk, implement-ability, and maintainability. A framework was developed identifying four high-level interventions: data and knowledge mobilization; public-private collaborative freight evaluations; government funding and political support; and, capacity alterations: improvements and expansions. The key concepts of the framework are to collect and analyze data to inform public-private stakeholder evaluations of policy interventions, with government funding to support both knowledge generation efforts, policy actions and capacity investments. There is a significant need to expand data collection and information sharing, focus infrastructure investments on public transit and intermodal accessibility, and integrated policy development towards transportation and land use planning to address the physical and policy barriers affecting freight mobility and congestion. The emergent theory is contrasted with selected global regions to assess generalizability and the relevance of international perspectives to the Canadian environment.},

   abstract = {In some situations in urban modeling practice, data cannot be preserved at the highest possible level of resolution. For example, when data from different sources are collated, the areal partitioning systems may not be compatible with each, other. In other cases, related but separated models (e.g., urban transportation land use and environmental models) may have been designed to operate at different spatial scales, posing a challenge to any efforts to link them. In these and similar situations, a method for interpolating data is required to produce compatible zoning systems or data at a desired level of resolution. A nonstationary (location-specific) spatial interpolation method, which has various potential applications in transportation as well as urban modeling, is proposed. The method combines the concept of location-specific parameters of a geographically weighted regression model and the concept of variogram function of kriging used to model spatial autocorrelation. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the application of the method in situations that are common in urban and transportation analysis. The results suggest that the method can be a useful alternative for spatial interpolation when nonstationarity and spatial autocorrelation appear coincidentally in the analysis. The model is therefore expected to help to improve the performance of urban models by providing more accurate data at desired levels of resolution.},

   abstract = {Previous activity-based studies have shown that behavioural outcomes are the result of complex and multi-dimensional processes. In this context, identifying and characterizing discrete mobility profiles through the classification of people's behavior is particularly attractive. By facilitating the interpretation of complex, multidimensional processes, such an exercise could help to efficiently target transport policy decisions. The purpose of this paper is to identify mobility strategy profiles considering four key dimensions: time, space, money, and social interaction. Data from a seven-day activity, travel, expenditure, and social interaction diary applied to a sample of residents from the city of Concepcion, Chile, is used. A two-step approach based on machine learning techniques is adopted. First, we use a Self-Organizing Map algorithm to identify seven distinct mobility strategies, each characterized by distinctive behaviors. These profiles are identified through 18 weekday and weekend daily behavior variables measuring the four key dimensions mentioned above, with an explicit focus on transport mode use. In the second step, we use a Decision Tree algorithm to profile the mobility strategies by means of personal and household sociodemographic variables. The results show interesting links among the dimensions of analysis within these profiles, such as connections between monetary expenditure on leisure and daily social interaction, and that profiles with higher private vehicle modal split tend to present higher levels of social interaction with people in their social network than public transit users.},

In this paper the perception of sense of community among neighbourhood residents is investigated. Drawing from research on tertiary street-communities (t-communities), the paper explores the effect of the urban landscape, particularly street networks, and neighbourhood and individual characteristics on sense of community. A sample of students at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, is used for the analysis. In addition to providing an opportunity to study sense of community, a student sample is interesting in its own right, as students are often a component of essential but at times uneasy relations between universities and towns. Analysis is based on the application of an ordered probit model with a spatial lag. The results provide evidence that t-community membership can influence sense of community.},

   abstract = {In recent years, interest in the travel behavior of students in institutions of higher education has grown. It has been noted that students tend to use a variety of transportation modes, including active travel, more frequently than other population segments. Investigating the modal choice of university students provides a unique opportunity to understand a population that has a large proportion of active commuters at a major trip-generating location. In turn, this can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence active travel. In this paper, we report the results of a mode choice analysis among university students, using as a case study McMaster University, in Hamilton, Canada. The results from this research indicate that modal choices are influenced by a combination of cost, individual attitudes, and environmental factors such as street and sidewalk density. A key finding is that travel time by car and bicycle positively affect the utilities of these modes, although at a decreasing rate as travel time increases. While the positive utility of time spent traveling by car has been documented in other settings, our analysis provides evidence of the intrinsic value that cyclists place on their trip experience. Examples of transportation policy measures suggested by the analysis are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

New offerings in higher education provide sustainability training to complement studies in geography, engineering, science, and other disciplines, in many cases including innovative experiential learning components - including the use of reflection. Although reflection in education is not a new concept, how to assess reflection has remained challenging. Recent research on the Reflective Learning Framework (RLF) aims to address many of the challenges associated with guiding, assessing, and evaluating student learning through reflections. The objective of this research was to investigate the perceptions of students who use the RLF about their experience using reflection in a sustainability course. Semi-structured interviews with students provide a valuable perspective on the use of reflection. Particularly, findings from this research indicate that students see reflection as a tool to develop and use cognitive and metacognitive skills, and also as a tool to support knowledge retention and transfer. Accordingly, student perspectives on reflection show that this practice contributes to the acquisition of higher-order thinking skills required to address the complex challenges of sustainability.},

   abstract = {Two important objectives in hedonic price analysis are to predict sale prices and delineate submarkets based on geographical and functional considerations. In this paper, we applied Bayesian models with spatially varying coefficients in an analysis of housing sale prices in the city of Toronto, Ontario to address these objectives. We evaluated model performance and identified patterns of submarkets indicated by the spatial coefficient processes. Our results show that Bayesian spatial process models predict housing sale prices well, provide useful inference regarding heterogeneity in prices within a market, and may be specified to include expert market opinions.},

   abstract = {Many institutions of higher education increasingly place a focus on various forms of experiential education, including personal reflections. While much work has been done in this and related areas, the resources currently available are not sufficient to effectively guide, assess, and evaluate student learning through reflection. Guiding students through the process, assessing their work, and providing an evaluation presents challenges for educators. This article discusses a new framework, a robust rubric, and a guide that students and evaluators can use to support experiential learning through reflection. The framework and resources are based on a grounded investigation of student reflections that were compared to various models from the literature. The framework and resources discussed in the article were developed over a period of five years and with more than 1,600 students. Our purpose here is to describe the development of this framework, to provide a description of the rubric and guide, and to share the lessons learned. This framework and accompanying materials will, we hope, be a useful resource for educators and students wishing to support experiential learning through the use of reflection.},

   abstract = {The effect of social interactions on decision-making is a topic of current interest in the travel behavior literature. These interactions have been investigated primarily from an intra-household perspective, but increasingly too in other types of social settings. In the case of interactions within a workplace, it has been suggested that the decision to telecommute may have some important social components. Previous research has concentrated on social isolation, and the effect on job satisfaction of qualitatively different (i.e., telecommunications-mediated) relationships with managers and colleagues. A topic that remains unexplored is the way social norms, in effect the influence of other people's behavior, may influence the decision to adopt telecommuting. In this paper we set to investigate, within a qualitative framework, the role of social contact in the process of acquiring information on, and making decisions about, telecommuting. The results indicate that social contact does play a subtle but non-trivial role in the adoption and continuation process, and offer some insights about the importance of the social dimension, institutional set-up, and how they interact to influence the decision to telecommute.
