# About Me

* I trained in civil engineering before being adopted into geography.
* My areas of interest include transportation, equity, justice, spatial analysis, spatial statistics, travel behavior, and cities.
* Also Open Science and Open Educational Resources.
* A 2024 global bibliometric analysis by [Research.com](https://research.com/scientists-rankings/social-sciences-and-humanities/ca) of the most influential scholars in the social sciences and humanities (about 16,000 researchers) places me in the **top 3%** of scholars in the world. 
<!-- Ranked 1904 of 16,000 (12%), and the 16,000 are already in the top 2% of scholars according to the Stanford Science Wide Indicators--> 
* In 2024 I was recognized with the **Edward L. Ullman Award** of the Association of American Geographers for lifelong commitment and contributions to the field of transportation geography.
* In 2010 a research team I led was recognized with the **Meredith F. Burrill Award** of the Association of American Geographers for exceptional work at the intersection of policy and basic research in geography.
